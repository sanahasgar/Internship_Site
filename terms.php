                    Once you accept an internship offer, you must make every possible effort to join and start the
                    internship on time. To not show up or to decline an earlier accepted internship offer at the last
                    moment, or to go incommunicado creates a very poor impression of you in front of the Employer and
                    reduces the credibility of the Applicant community at large. Any such behaviour will not only result in
                    your account being blocked on Internshala but we will also report it to your college administration
                    wherever applicable.

                <li>
                    Internships details communicated to Applicants at any stage are same as advertised on Internshala and
                    there is no negative material difference (Ex. - offering lower or no stipend than what was advertised on

                <li>
                    Any assignment(s) that they may give to Applicants to assess their suitability for the internship should
                    be fair and relevant to the internship profile. Any attempt to get work done for free from Applicants

                    must not contain any obscene or offensive content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once they hire any Applicant(s) for their internship, they must provide them with an offer letter
                    clearly detailing all the important details of the internship (such as role & responsibilities, duration
                    of the internship, stipend and payment mechanism) and complete address and contact details of Employer.
                </li>
